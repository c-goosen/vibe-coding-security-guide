# vibe-coding-security-guide aka VibeSecOps
Guide to safer and secure co-piloted coding. Not a fan of the term "vibe coding", but its in the modern venacular so it might stick around like vulns have stuck around software.

## Intro 
Cursor, chatgpt and other tools might be here to stay and before univerisities teach this, we need to attempt to reach developers on the good news of security. Pro-active vs reactive security with vibe coding is the idea.

Note that I have made a point of not using genAI to write this guide.
